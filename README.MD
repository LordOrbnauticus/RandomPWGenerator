# Python Password Generator

I've been having to use this a lot in the past few days... Figure I could just go a head and write it up so I can have it reado on all my devices... :information_desk_person:

There is a .desktop file I'll need to edit for all my linux needs:

```[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=RandomPWGen
Comment=RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR!!!
Exec=[python .py Path]
Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/python.xpm
Path=[path to the folder]
Terminal=True
StartupNotify=true
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;Application;
```

You can add the .desktop file to `/usr/local/share/application` to run it with a simple click!

Also `ln -s $PATH ~/Desktop` will give you... a desktop version :joy:
